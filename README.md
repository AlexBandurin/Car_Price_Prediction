# Car_Price_Prediction

This is a web application that takes information about a vehicle such as year, make, model, mileage, condition, color, etc. as well as a description (NLP is used to process text input) and outputs an estimated price. It uses a machine learning algorithm trained on tens of thousands of used car listings that have been obtained through web scraping of classifieds websites.
Additionally, it will retrieve similar vehicle listings from an Azure database  .
